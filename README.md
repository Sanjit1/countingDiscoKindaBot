# Discord Counting Bot
This bot is not your regular Discord Bot. It takes control of your mouse and keyboard and spams incrementing numbers on a discord text channel.

## Steps:
- [Install Python3](https://github.com/Sanjit1/countingDiscoKindaBot#InstallPython3)
- [Install the script and pyautogui](https://github.com/Sanjit1/countingDiscoKindaBot#Installthescriptandpyautogui)
- [Running the script](https://github.com/Sanjit1/countingDiscoKindaBot#RunningtheScript)
- [Warning](/#Warning)
### Install Python3:
You know how to do this dumbasss:
- Go to Python
- Download
[Here is a](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381#Files) [quick link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)

<sup><sup><sub>You really thot</sub></sup></sup>

### Install the script and pyautogui:
Make a random folder in your computer and call it HackDisco or something. In that directory, make a .py file and copy all the code from [here](https://github.com/Sanjit1/countingDiscoKindaBot/blob/master/app.py), to that file and save. Then, navigate to the same folder, from your terminal and run `pip install pyautogui`.

### Running the Script
Make some changes to the script before you run the script.
Go to line 60, and edit the spam command.
`spam(start, end, time)`
start tis what number to start at. If the last number of counting was 6763, you want to make the bot count till 10,000:
![Count](/count.png)
You would change it too `spam(6763,10000,time)`
As mentioned in the code the `time` depends on your wifi speed, so.. test before running.
Now that you are ready to run, split screen your terminal and discord, and execute `python app.py`. Now quick. You have less than 15 seconds to move your cursor to the Message counting input box, before it will start spamming numbers.
Have Fun!
